# AWS production deploy: jobcron.app

> **Alpha launch:** The active end-to-end runbook is the concise
> [human-assisted alpha deployment specification](../../docs/specs/260923-human-assisted-alpha-deployment.md).
> This directory remains the technical runtime reference; its earlier Slice 4
> sequencing is not independent authorization to execute every step.

## Slice 4 status

This directory now implements the replacement-host runtime, but running it is a
separate human-authorized operation. The operator must begin from the exact
Slice 3 checkpoint, publish the approved private `linux/arm64` image through the
repository workflow, and record its immutable digest in private evidence.
Terraform may apply only the independently reviewed saved plan accepted by
`scripts/check-terraform-slice-4-plan.sh`.

The verified Slice 3 checkpoint provides private database subnets, a
VPC-local-only database route table, security-group-only PostgreSQL access, an
encrypted private RDS instance, an empty runtime-secret container, and a
protected recovery bucket. The secret remains empty until this Slice 4
sequence writes its first version outside Terraform. Verified off-cloud
recovery objects expire after 14 days, all current versions expire after 90
days, and the resulting noncurrent data version expires one day later.

The replacement host has no key pair or inbound rule. All host and database
access uses AWS Systems Manager Session Manager. RDS stays private, and the app
uses a lower-privilege database role created through a localhost-only tunnel.
The reserved EIP remains unattached, and the operator stops before any
Cloudflare, DNS, or public-traffic action.

## Runtime contract

Production secrets do not live in the repository, Terraform state, or a host
environment file. `jobcron.service` retrieves the approved Secrets Manager
version into `/run/jobcron`, validates the exact key set, pulls only the
approved digest, and starts Compose through systemd. The one-shot
`read:packages` registry token is separate from the runtime secret and is
deleted with its temporary Docker configuration after the pull.

The runtime is fail-closed: incomplete secrets, unexpected values, bad file
modes, or a failed pull leave both containers stopped and no partial runtime
files. On reboot, the memory-backed `/run/jobcron` directory is empty and
systemd recreates it from the approved secret. `verify-local-state` reports
value-blind booleans and counts for file modes, log rotation, digest retention,
Docker credentials, and free disk space.

## Files

- `compose.yaml` consumes `/run/jobcron/compose.env`, pulls the approved
  immutable image, reaches private RDS through `DATABASE_URL`, and retains only
  Caddy's standard volumes.
- `Caddyfile` uses transient Origin CA material from `/run/jobcron/caddy`,
  redirects `www.jobcron.app`, and keeps app access private.
- `.env.example` contains synthetic local-render inputs only.
- `Dockerfile` builds the release image used by the private publication
  workflow.
- `jobcron-runtime.sh` implements `prepare`, `pull`, `archive`, and
  `verify-local-state`.
- `systemd/` contains the fail-closed app service and nightly recovery units.
- `HUMAN_DEPLOY_GUIDE.md` defines the exact-plan, Session Manager, private
  verification, recovery manifest, reboot, and stop-condition sequence.

## Validate Compose locally

Use synthetic values only:

```sh
cd deploy/production
JOBCRON_IMAGE='ghcr.io/example/jobcron@sha256:0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000' \
DATABASE_URL='postgres://example:example@db.example.invalid:5432/example?sslmode=require' \
SESSION_SECRET=synthetic-session-secret \
JOBCRON_CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY='MDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDA=' \
JOBCRON_PROXY_SECRET='synthetic-proxy-secret' \
JOBCRON_SIGNUP_ACCESS_CODE='synthetic-cohort-code' \
JOBCRON_STAGE1_SPONSOR_USER_ID='1' \
docker compose config
```

The rendered config must keep the app on loopback host port `7777` and publish
only Caddy on host TCP `443`. During private deployment the origin security
group has no ingress and the reserved EIP remains unattached; at cutover its
only ingress is Cloudflare-prefix-list TCP `443`. The config must include the
database, session, credential-key, production, no-open, scheduler, and signup
settings; and contain no app filesystem or legacy credential volume.
It must not include demo mode, an admin token, a Worknet key, or a
caller-supplied trusted-proxy header. Caddy and the app receive the same proxy
secret so only Caddy can supply the client address used by authentication rate
limits.

## Private operations and recovery

Private verification uses Session Manager port forwarding to the app on host
port `7777` and Caddy on host port `443`. The operator checks real user
behavior, the Origin CA certificate, lower-privilege RDS access, reboot
recovery, and the absence of public ingress before recording sanitized
evidence.

Slice 5 discovers the origin security group through the fixed
`jobcron:edge-target = origin-security-group` tag and derives the canonical VPC
from that group's `vpc_id`. The canonical VPC intentionally remains untagged.

`jobcron-recovery.service` creates a custom-format database dump, sanitized
container logs, and SHA-256 recovery manifests. The trusted Mac runs
`scripts/pull-production-recovery.sh` to copy missing objects, verify every
manifest, and apply only the `macbook-copy=verified` tag. Restore verification
uses a disposable database and bounded schema and row-count comparisons.

Stop conditions include any checkpoint mismatch, unapproved saved-plan action,
private value in shared output, public ingress, incomplete runtime secret,
failed private user path, failed recovery verification, or less than 2 GiB free
after normal pruning. Keep the old host, old database, reserved EIP, prior
image, and recovery materials throughout the rollback window.
