# PostgreSQL Local Convergence And Per-User AI Credentials

**Date:** 2026-07-14
**Status:** Draft for approval
**Scope:** Writable local app, production credential storage, and user-scoped AI state

## Context

Jobcron currently has two writable persistence modes. A normal local launch falls
back to SQLite, while production uses PostgreSQL when `DATABASE_URL` is present.
AI credentials live outside both databases in one global `ai_keys.json`. The
repository's production Compose file declares a `jobcron_config` volume for that
file, but Jobcron has not been deployed to EC2. The instance currently has only
the application `.env`; Docker, the app, and the owner account are not set up.

That split no longer matches the hosted-first product. Account data and AI results
must follow the authenticated user across devices, and one server-wide key file
cannot safely support more than one account. This specification makes PostgreSQL
the only writable application database, migrates existing local state once, and
stores one encrypted AI credential per user and provider.

This work starts before public launch. It supersedes only the timing in
[`260714-hosted-first-local-database-convergence.md`](../decisions/260714-hosted-first-local-database-convergence.md):
the accepted convergence outcome remains, but it is no longer deferred until
after launch.

## Locked Product Decisions

1. The current owner-only account UI remains. Public signup, account recovery,
   organizations, and team accounts are not added here.
2. PostgreSQL storage must nevertheless be safe for multiple user rows. Two test
   users must not share credentials, AI scores, usage budgets, profiles, bookmarks,
   or hidden state.
3. All existing local SQLite state is preserved through a verified one-time
   migration: profile, postings, rule scores, bookmarks, hidden jobs, AI
   extractions, AI scores, AI usage, and the existing AI credential when present.
4. Local PostgreSQL 18 starts automatically through Docker Compose when a normal
   local run has no explicit `DATABASE_URL`.
5. Each user may have at most one encrypted credential for each provider. The UI
   initially supports only `anthropic`; the schema must not require a migration to
   add another validated provider later.

## Verified Current State

Code verified against `main` on 2026-07-14. Production EC2 preparation state
confirmed on 2026-07-15.

### Runtime selection

- **Current:** `cmd/jobcron/main.go:144-153` opens PostgreSQL only when
  `DATABASE_URL` is set; `--db` and the default path open SQLite.
- **Gap:** A normal writable launch silently remains on SQLite.

### Local database

- **Current:** `deploy/local/compose.yaml:1-13` provides PostgreSQL 18 on port
  `55432`, but the operator must start it and export the URL manually.
- **Gap:** Local startup is not automatic and has no health check.

### Local preview

- **Current:** `scripts/preview-interactive.sh:12-39` creates a temporary SQLite
  database.
- **Gap:** Preview does not exercise the production persistence backend.

### User state

- **Current:** PostgreSQL migration `0006_user_scoped_state.sql` scopes profiles,
  scores, bookmarks, and hidden state by `user_id`.
- **Gap:** The older global AI tables were not included.

### AI credentials

- **Current:** `internal/ai/keys.go:16-86` stores a provider-to-key JSON map on
  disk. `internal/server/handlers.go:617-635` writes it without a user ID.
- **Gap:** Every account on one server would share and overwrite the same key.

### AI runtime

- **Current:** `internal/server/server.go:114-149` keeps one mutable provider,
  model, version, and budget configuration on `Server`.
- **Gap:** Saving one user's profile changes the AI runtime for every request.

### AI score cache

- **Current:** `internal/storage/ai_scores.go:14-92` keys cached deltas by posting,
  goal hash, and AI version, and prunes without `user_id`.
- **Gap:** One user's stale fallback or pruning can expose or delete another
  user's profile-derived result.

### AI usage

- **Current:** `internal/storage/ai_usage.go:11-62` aggregates usage by day only.
- **Gap:** Token and cost limits are server-global rather than account-scoped.

### Existing importer

- **Current:** `cmd/jobcron-import/main.go` copies eight SQLite data categories in
  one PostgreSQL transaction. Integration tests cover representative data,
  rollback, idempotent upserts, and owner-password preservation.
- **Gap:** It does not create a consistent source snapshot, record a completed
  import, migrate credentials, or verify post-commit counts.

### Production Compose

- **Current:** `deploy/production/compose.yaml:29-30,47-48` declares and mounts
  `jobcron_config`, although that configuration has not been deployed to EC2.
- **Gap:** Leaving it in the first production deployment would introduce obsolete,
  host-local credential storage that is not account-scoped.

No similar open GitHub issue was found using the terms `PostgreSQL SQLite AI
credentials`.

## Goals

- Give local, production, and test code one writable SQL behavior: PostgreSQL.
- Preserve the current local user's data without silently mutating the source.
- Store AI credentials encrypted at rest and keyed by the authenticated user.
- Make AI score caches and usage budgets user-scoped.
- Remove `jobcron_config` before the first production application deployment.
- Keep offline scoring functional when a credential is missing or unreadable.
- Provide a cutover and rollback procedure that never deletes the only copy of
  user data or credentials.

## Non-Goals

- Public signup, multiple owners, password recovery, social login, organizations,
  roles, or an account-management UI.
- Billing users for AI usage or providing a shared Jobcron-funded AI key.
- Supporting more than one credential for the same user and provider.
- Synchronizing two independent self-hosted PostgreSQL installations.
- Automatic master-key rotation or AWS KMS integration. The schema is versioned
  so rotation can be added without changing credential ownership.
- Secure deletion guarantees for an old SQLite or `ai_keys.json` file on SSDs.

Deferred account-expansion requirements are recorded in
[`260715-multi-user-account-expansion.md`](260715-multi-user-account-expansion.md).

```

The credential encryption master key stays outside PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL holds
only ciphertext. A database dump or RDS snapshot is therefore insufficient to
recover an API key without the separately protected master key.

## Proposed Change

### 1. Make PostgreSQL The Writable Runtime

Runtime resolution and store opening must use these rules. The `--db` flag is
removed in every mode; do not retain a parallel configuration-only store opener.

- **Production:** `DATABASE_URL` is required. Open the supplied PostgreSQL URL.
- **Normal local with `DATABASE_URL`:** Open the supplied PostgreSQL URL and
  never invoke Docker.
- **Normal local without `DATABASE_URL`:** Start or verify the embedded
  PostgreSQL Compose service, then open the fixed local URL.

The normal local URL is:

```text
postgres://postgres@127.0.0.1:55432/jobcron_dev?sslmode=disable
```

Add `internal/localdb` with the canonical PostgreSQL 18 Compose definition and an
`Ensure(ctx)` function. `Ensure` must:

1. run only for a non-production process with no explicit URL;
2. invoke `docker compose` with project name `jobcron-local`;
3. use an explicitly named `jobcron-postgres18-cluster` volume;
4. start the service with `up -d --wait` and a `pg_isready` health check;
5. time out after 60 seconds;
6. return the fixed local URL only after PostgreSQL accepts connections; and
7. return an actionable error when Docker, Compose, the daemon, port `55432`, or
   the health check is unavailable. The error must also explain that setting
   `DATABASE_URL` bypasses managed local startup.

`deploy/local/compose.yaml` remains the human-readable lifecycle surface. A
contract test must render it and the embedded definition and assert identical
image, port, database name, volume name, and health check so the two definitions
cannot drift.

The local PostgreSQL cluster survives ordinary app exits and container
replacement. Only an explicit documented reset may remove its volume.

### 2. Add The Per-User Credential Schema

Add PostgreSQL migration `0014_user_ai_credentials.sql` with this table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_ai_credentials (
    user_id             BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    provider            TEXT NOT NULL,
    ciphertext          BYTEA NOT NULL,
    nonce               BYTEA NOT NULL,
    encryption_version  SMALLINT NOT NULL,
    created_at          TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at          TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, provider),
    CHECK (provider <> ''),
    CHECK (octet_length(ciphertext) > 16),
    CHECK (octet_length(nonce) = 12),
    CHECK (encryption_version > 0)
);
```

Provider identifiers are normalized and validated in Go. The database permits a
future provider without a schema migration, while the current application still
accepts only `anthropic`.

Add storage operations whose public shapes contain ciphertext but never plaintext:

```go
type EncryptedAICredential struct {
    UserID            int64
    Provider          string
    Ciphertext        []byte
    Nonce             []byte
    EncryptionVersion int16
    UpdatedAt         time.Time
}

func (s *Store) UpsertUserAICredential(ctx context.Context, c EncryptedAICredential) error
func (s *Store) UserAICredential(ctx context.Context, userID int64, provider string) (EncryptedAICredential, bool, error)
func (s *Store) DeleteUserAICredential(ctx context.Context, userID int64, provider string) error
```

Blank credential input keeps the existing row, matching the current profile
form. Turning AI off keeps the encrypted row so re-enabling does not require
re-entry. Explicit credential deletion is an internal storage operation in this
scope; a new delete-key UI is deferred to the account-expansion specification.

### 3. Encrypt Credentials At The Application Boundary

Add `internal/credential` with AES-256-GCM encryption. AES-GCM encrypts and also
detects ciphertext tampering. Its contract is:

```go
type Cipher interface {
    Seal(userID int64, provider, plaintext string) (ciphertext, nonce []byte, version int16, err error)
    Open(userID int64, provider string, ciphertext, nonce []byte, version int16) (string, error)
}
```

Requirements:

- The master key is exactly 32 random bytes, represented as base64 when supplied
  through configuration.
- Production requires `JOBCRON_CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. Startup fails before
  serving requests when it is missing or malformed.
- A normal local run reads or creates
  `<OS config directory>/jobcron/credential-encryption.key` with mode `0600`.
  This server-level master key is not an AI credential and is never stored in
  PostgreSQL or a Docker volume.
- Every save uses a fresh 12-byte cryptographic nonce.
- Authenticated metadata binds the ciphertext to
  `jobcron:user-ai-credential:v1:<user_id>:<provider>`. Copying a row to another
  user or provider must therefore fail decryption.
- Version `1` means AES-256-GCM with this metadata format. Unknown versions fail
  closed without deleting or replacing the row.
- Plaintext keys must never appear in logs, errors, templates, telemetry, test
  snapshots, SQL parameters captured by assertions, or command output.
- A decryption failure disables paid AI for that user and returns a stable
  operator-visible error. Rule-based scoring and access to previously stored
  non-secret data continue to work.

The master key must be backed up separately from RDS. Losing it makes stored API
keys intentionally unrecoverable; users can restore service by entering a new
key after the credential row is replaced.

### 4. Make AI Runtime State User-Scoped

Remove `Server.ai`, `aiModel`, `aiVersion`, the four global budget fields,
`aiKeysPath`, `SetAIKeysPath`, and startup `ReconfigureAI`.

Replace them with an operation-scoped value:

```go
type AIRuntime struct {
    UserID          int64
    Provider        ai.Provider
    Version         string
    RunTokenCap     int
    DailyTokenCap   int
    MonthlyTokenCap int
    PerCallCap      int
}

func (s *Server) aiRuntimeForUser(ctx context.Context, userID int64) (*AIRuntime, error)
```

`aiRuntimeForUser` loads that user's profile, loads and decrypts that user's
credential, constructs the selected provider, and derives that user's limits.
It returns `nil, nil` when AI is off or no credential exists.

One resolved runtime must be passed through a complete scrape or rerate operation;
helpers must not repeatedly decrypt the credential. Authenticated manual scrape,
rerate, profile save, page rendering, and rescore paths must pass their explicit
`userID`. The existing owner-only scheduler resolves the sole owner at the start
of its run. If zero or more than one owner exists, it skips paid AI and records an
operator error rather than guessing. Multi-user scheduler fan-out is out of scope.

Profile save must resolve the authenticated user before handling the key. It then:

1. if a new key was entered, validate and encrypt it; otherwise, leave the
   existing credential row unchanged;
2. in one PostgreSQL transaction, upsert `(user_id, provider)` only when a new
   key exists and save the non-secret profile;
3. commit both changes before reporting success;
4. resolve a fresh runtime for that same user; and
5. rerate only that user's score rows.

If key preparation or the transaction fails, no partial credential/profile
combination may be presented as successfully saved. Provider construction and
paid calls occur only after commit.

### 5. Scope AI Scores And Usage By User

`ai_extractions` remains global. It derives facts only from public posting content
and is reusable when content hash and AI version match.

Using `ai_extractions` as a compact, cross-model Stage-2 input is deferred to the
[feature ideas document](../../product/feature-ideas.md#cross-model-ai-extraction-reuse-for-token-efficient-stage-2-scoring).
Cross-model reuse is allowed in principle; it first needs a provider-neutral
extraction schema and its own schema/prompt version so compatibility is not
incorrectly inferred from the model vendor alone.

Add PostgreSQL migration `0015_user_scoped_ai_state.sql` that replaces the other
two global tables with:

```sql
CREATE TABLE ai_scores_user_scoped (
    user_id       BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    posting_id    BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES postings(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    ai_input_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
    ai_version    TEXT NOT NULL,
    items_json    TEXT NOT NULL,
    net_delta     INTEGER NOT NULL,
    computed_at   TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, posting_id, ai_input_hash, ai_version)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_ai_scores_user_latest
    ON ai_scores_user_scoped(user_id, posting_id, ai_version, computed_at DESC);

CREATE TABLE ai_usage_user_scoped (
    user_id       BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    day           DATE NOT NULL,
    input_tokens  BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 CHECK (input_tokens >= 0),
    output_tokens BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 CHECK (output_tokens >= 0),
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, day)
);
```

The migration may assign existing global rows only when exactly one user exists.
If global rows exist with zero or multiple users, the migration must abort with
an actionable error instead of duplicating or guessing ownership.

Every AI-score lookup, upsert, stale fallback, and prune query must require
`user_id`. Pruning one user's provider/model history must not touch another
user's rows. Every usage read and debit must require `user_id`; daily and monthly
caps are calculated per user.

### 6. Upgrade The One-Time SQLite Import

Keep `cmd/jobcron-import` as the explicit operator tool. Normal app startup must
never import data silently.

Add PostgreSQL migration `0016_local_data_imports.sql`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE local_data_imports (
    user_id            BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    source_sha256      TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (length(source_sha256) = 64),
    source_counts      JSONB NOT NULL,
    imported_counts    JSONB NOT NULL,
    completed_at       TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, source_sha256)
);
```

The importer workflow is:

1. Require the operator to stop the legacy local app, then independently take a
   no-wait SQLite write lock and refuse any concurrent writer.
2. Create a consistent SQLite snapshot with SQLite's own backup/VACUUM mechanism;
   do not copy only `jobs.db` while WAL data may exist.
3. Compute SHA-256 over that immutable snapshot. Never store its private path.
4. Dry-run by default. Print source counts, target collision counts, the owner
   email placeholder supplied by the operator, credential provider names, and the
   fingerprint. Never print profile JSON, key bytes, endpoints, or passwords.
5. Require `--apply` for writes. Preserve the existing owner's password hash.
6. In one PostgreSQL transaction, import postings, profile, user scores,
   bookmarks, hidden jobs, AI extractions, user-scoped AI scores, user-scoped AI
   usage, and an encrypted credential from an optional legacy `ai_keys.json`.
7. Insert `local_data_imports` only after all writes and count checks succeed.
8. After commit, re-read target rows scoped to the owner and compare every source
   category. A mismatch is a failed verification even though the transaction
   committed; the operator must use the documented PostgreSQL rollback rather
   than rerun blindly.
9. A repeated `--apply` with the same owner and fingerprint performs verification
   only and exits successfully with `already imported`; it performs no writes.
10. A different snapshot targeting an owner who already has imported state is
    refused unless the target has been explicitly reset. There is no `--force`
    overwrite flag.

Source-safety verification preserves byte hashes for the durable SQLite
database and `-wal` plus the optional legacy key file, and compares source
schema and rows before and after import. It deliberately does not require
`-shm` byte identity: SQLite documents `-shm` as the non-persistent,
rebuildable WAL index, and readers maintain coordination bytes there. The
importer still uses SQLite's online backup API only; raw file copying is not a
fallback.

Required command shape:

```sh
jobcron-import \
  --sqlite '<immutable-sqlite-snapshot>' \
  --postgres '<postgresql-url>' \
  --owner-email '<owner-email>' \
  --ai-keys '<optional-legacy-ai-keys-file>'

jobcron-import \
  --sqlite '<immutable-sqlite-snapshot>' \
  --postgres '<postgresql-url>' \
  --owner-email '<owner-email>' \
  --ai-keys '<optional-legacy-ai-keys-file>' \
  --apply
```

The encryption master key is obtained through the same production/local
configuration rules as the app, never from a command-line argument.

The original SQLite snapshot and `ai_keys.json` remain untouched until browser
verification passes. Documentation then tells the operator how to remove the
plaintext key file. The tool must not claim secure erasure.

### 7. Convert The Writable Preview

Update `scripts/preview-interactive.sh` to:

1. ensure the local PostgreSQL Compose service is healthy;
2. create a uniquely named temporary PostgreSQL database;
3. create a temporary local credential-encryption key;
4. run the app with that database and key;
5. drop the database and key on exit; and
6. retain and print their locations only when `JOBCRON_PREVIEW_KEEP=1`.

The preview must not connect to `jobcron_dev`, production RDS, or the legacy
SQLite file. Its test must prove isolation by writing a profile and asserting
that neither the normal local database nor a second preview contains it.

### 8. Prepare The First Production Deployment

The final `deploy/production/compose.yaml` must:

- remove the app mount at `/root/.config/jobcron`;
- remove the top-level `jobcron_config` declaration;
- require `JOBCRON_CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY`; and
- retain the RDS URL, session secret, and Caddy volumes.

The existing EC2 `.env` already contains `DATABASE_URL`, `SESSION_SECRET`, and:

```dotenv
JOBCRON_ENV=production
JOBCRON_HOST=0.0.0.0
JOBCRON_PORT=7777
JOBCRON_NO_OPEN=1
JOBCRON_DAILY_SCRAPE_TIME=05:00
```

Keep those values and add `JOBCRON_CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. Do not replace the
existing database URL or session secret.

Production migration runs from a trusted local checkout through the existing
localhost-only SSH tunnel to private RDS. The local importer reads the retained
SQLite snapshot and optional local `ai_keys.json`; no production image, Compose
override, EC2 path, or Docker volume is used for legacy credential migration.

Production sequence:

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose on EC2.
2. Add the credential-encryption key to the existing `.env`.
3. Through the localhost-only SSH tunnel, create the sole owner, snapshot RDS,
   then run the importer dry-run and `--apply` from the trusted local checkout.
4. Deploy the app with the final Compose file, which has no `jobcron_config`.
5. Sign in, verify the migrated profile, ratings, and masked-key state, run one
   approved AI rating, then recreate the app container and verify persistence.
6. Keep the original local SQLite snapshot and `ai_keys.json` until the human
   closes the rollback window.

## Failure Modes And Required Behavior

- **Docker CLI or daemon missing locally:** Exit before app startup with
  installation and `DATABASE_URL` bypass guidance.
- **Port `55432` already belongs to another process:** Do not attach to it
  blindly; identify the conflict and refuse managed startup.
- **PostgreSQL health check times out:** Leave diagnostic container state intact
  and return the Compose service and status commands.
- **Legacy SQLite source is live or inconsistent:** Refuse import; do not modify
  source or target.
- **Import copy or count check fails:** Roll back the entire PostgreSQL
  transaction; do not write the import ledger row.
- **Import post-commit verification fails:** Stop. Preserve source and target;
  restore the pre-import PostgreSQL snapshot or volume.
- **Existing global AI rows have ambiguous ownership:** Abort schema migration
  before changing the old tables.
- **Encryption master key is missing or malformed:** Production startup fails
  closed; local startup creates a protected local key only outside production.
- **Credential ciphertext, nonce, version, user, or provider is wrong:** Disable
  paid AI for that user, preserve the row, and surface a non-secret error.
- **Credential save succeeds but profile save fails:** Roll back both database
  changes.
- **Provider returns unauthorized:** Keep the encrypted credential, show a safe
  re-entry message, and do not expose provider response bodies.
- **One user changes provider, model, or key:** Invalidate only that user's
  runtime and caches; other users are unchanged.
- **EC2 is lost but RDS survives:** Restore the separately protected master key
  or require users to replace credentials.

                                                                                        │

```

Schema and encryption land first because every later path depends on stable
storage contracts. Runtime isolation lands before credential cutover so a stored
per-user key cannot accidentally feed the existing global provider. The importer
lands before SQLite fallback removal. The first production deployment happens
only after the owner, imported rows, encrypted credential, and rollback evidence
exist in RDS; production never receives the legacy credential volume.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A normal writable app launch never opens or creates SQLite.
2. With an explicit valid `DATABASE_URL`, startup opens that PostgreSQL database
   and never invokes Docker.
3. Without `DATABASE_URL`, a normal local launch starts PostgreSQL 18 through
   Compose, waits for health, and opens `jobcron_dev` on port `55432`.
4. Production refuses to start without a valid PostgreSQL URL, session secret,
   and 32-byte credential-encryption key.
5. The main `jobcron` command no longer accepts `--db`; only `jobcron-import`
   accepts an explicit legacy SQLite source through `--sqlite`.
6. The writable preview uses a disposable PostgreSQL database and leaves the
   normal local and production databases unchanged.
7. `user_ai_credentials` contains at most one row per user/provider and no
   plaintext API key can be found in PostgreSQL text output, logs, or files under
   the repository.
8. Ciphertext copied to another user or provider fails decryption.
9. Saving a blank key preserves the existing encrypted credential; saving a new
   key replaces only that user's provider row.
10. User A and User B can store different Anthropic keys. A manual AI operation
    for either user constructs a provider with only that user's key.
11. The server has no mutable global AI provider, model, version, or budget state.
12. PostgreSQL AI-score rows, stale fallbacks, pruning, and usage ledgers require
    `user_id`; operations for one user do not read, overwrite, prune, or debit the
    other user's rows.
13. Existing one-owner PostgreSQL AI rows migrate without loss; ambiguous ownership
    aborts before either old table is dropped.
14. The importer dry-run reports all eight existing data categories, credential
    provider count, collisions, and source fingerprint without writing target data.
15. Import `--apply` preserves profile, postings, rule scores, bookmarks, hidden
    jobs, AI extractions, per-user AI scores, per-user AI usage, and the optional
    credential in one transaction.
16. The first-deploy workflow creates the sole owner before import. The importer
    targets that same owner email, preserves the newly chosen password hash, and
    never imports sessions or plaintext passwords.
17. A forced failure in any copied category leaves all target category counts and
    credentials unchanged.
18. Repeating the same completed import performs verification only; a different
    source is refused rather than merged implicitly.
19. The source SQLite snapshot and legacy key file are not modified or deleted by
    the importer.
20. Existing profile values, at least one rule score, one AI score, one bookmark,
    one hidden job, and AI usage totals match between source and target verification.
21. The production Compose render has no `jobcron_config` declaration or
    `/root/.config/jobcron` mount.
22. Production import runs from a trusted local checkout through the
    localhost-only SSH tunnel; no production migration service is required.
23. After the first deployment, the newly created owner can sign in, see the
    migrated profile and ratings, and use the encrypted credential. Deliberately
    recreating the new app container preserves that database-backed state.
24. Missing credentials or decryption failures fall back to rule-based scoring for
    the affected user without crashing the app or exposing secret material.
25. English and Korean documentation no longer describe SQLite as the normal
    writable database or `jobcron_config` as production credential storage.
26. The light and dark README dashboard screenshots show score-sorted results
    with AI deltas applied and visible AI-delta detail chips.
27. `gofmt -l .`, `go vet ./...`, `go test -race ./...`, the PostgreSQL integration
    suite, Compose contract tests, import tests, and browser journeys all pass.

## Testing Plan

### Unit

- **Minimum new coverage:** 18 tests.
- **Required cases:** Cipher round trip, nonce uniqueness, wrong key, wrong user,
  wrong provider, wrong version, invalid key size, config validation, and the
  local-startup decision rules.

### Storage

- **Minimum new coverage:** 12 tests.
- **Required cases:** Credential CRUD and isolation, AI-score isolation and
  pruning, usage isolation and monthly queries, one-owner migration, and
  ambiguous-owner rejection.

### Import integration

- **Minimum new coverage:** 8 tests.
- **Required cases:** Dry run, full copy, credential copy, password preservation,
  transaction rollback, same-fingerprint verification, different-source refusal,
  and count mismatch.

### Server

- **Minimum new coverage:** 10 tests.
- **Required cases:** Two-user key isolation, transactional profile save, no-key
  fallback, decrypt failure, provider failure, and user-scoped rerate, scrape,
  score, and budget behavior.

### Compose and process

- **Minimum new coverage:** 4 tests.
- **Required cases:** Automatic start, explicit-URL bypass, health timeout, and
  preview-database cleanup and isolation.

### Browser

- **Minimum new coverage:** 5 journeys.
- **Required cases:** Migrated state, key save and masked state, durability after
  container recreation, two-session account isolation with seeded users, and
  light/dark README screenshot capture with applied AI deltas visible.

### Regression

- **Minimum new coverage:** Existing suites.
- **Required cases:** Full Go tests with the race detector, builds of all shipped
  commands, production and local Compose renders, and English and Korean doc
  checks.

Integration tests must use disposable PostgreSQL schemas or databases. They must
never reset the developer's normal `jobcron_dev`, production RDS, or the retained
legacy SQLite source.

## Rollback Plan

### Before import commit

- The importer transaction rolls back automatically.
- Production has not been deployed yet. Keep the immutable local SQLite snapshot
  and legacy key file untouched; the old local binary may continue using the
  original source until local cutover.

### After import but before PostgreSQL-only writes

- Stop the new app.
- Restore the pre-import RDS snapshot or remove only the disposable local
  PostgreSQL volume.
- Re-run owner creation and import only from the documented clean state. There is
  no prior production app or Compose deployment to restore.

### After PostgreSQL-only writes begin

- Do not switch back to SQLite; doing so would discard newer account changes.
- Roll back application code while keeping the PostgreSQL schema compatible, or
  restore a PostgreSQL backup and replay only explicitly approved data.
- Keep the credential master key, immutable SQLite snapshot, legacy local key
  file, and pre-import RDS snapshot through the rollback window.

No rollback command may run `docker compose down -v` against an unidentified
Compose project or delete the source snapshot automatically.

## Implementation Slices And Effort

This is epic-sized and should land in dependency order through reviewable commits.

Slice work:

1. PostgreSQL migrations, credential cipher, configuration, and storage APIs.
2. User-scoped AI runtime, scores, usage, and server tests.
3. Local Compose bootstrap and PostgreSQL preview.
4. Import snapshot, ledger, credential migration, and verification.
5. First production deployment, browser QA, documentation, and security review.

|     Slice | Human estimate    | AI-agent estimate |
| --------: | ----------------- | ----------------- |
|         1 | 1.5-2 days        | 3-5 hours         |
|         2 | 2-3 days          | 6-10 hours        |
|         3 | 1-1.5 days        | 3-5 hours         |
|         4 | 1.5-2 days        | 4-7 hours         |
|         5 | 1.5-2 days        | 4-7 hours         |
| **Total** | **7.5-10.5 days** | **20-34 hours**   |

## Security And Publication Requirements

- Never commit or print a real API key, credential master key, database URL,
  account identity, host address, SQLite source path, or legacy key-file contents.
- Tests use deterministic fake keys only and assert that plaintext is absent from
  error strings and captured logs.
- Production documentation uses placeholders and tells the operator to keep the
  master key in the existing access-controlled secret workflow.
- Before committing this specification or implementation documentation, inspect
  the staged diff, run the configured secret scanner, and perform a manual public
  publication review.

## Definition Of Done

All 27 acceptance criteria pass on the exact commit proposed for deployment. The
local SQLite snapshot, production RDS snapshot, credential master key, and legacy
local key file remain available through the human-approved rollback window. Only
then may the old local plaintext key file be removed.
