# Architecture

Jobcron is a single Go web application that scrapes Korean job boards, stores normalized
postings in PostgreSQL, scores them for one owner, and serves an embedded HTML interface.
Optional AI calls extract global eligibility facts, validate user-specific dealbreaker hits in
context, and enrich score explanations. The deterministic scoring path remains complete when AI
is disabled or unavailable.

This document describes the implemented architecture as of 2026-07-19. Approved future work is
listed separately so it is not mistaken for current behavior.

## System at a glance

```text
Browser
   |
   | HTTPS through Caddy in production; direct HTTP in local development
   v
jobcron process
   |-- net/http routes -> embedded templates, CSS, and JavaScript
   |-- in-process daily scheduler
   |-- scraper adapters -> public job-board endpoints
   |-- deterministic scoring -> optional Anthropic calls
   `-- storage repositories -> PostgreSQL
```

The production process is intentionally small. There is no separate frontend server, worker
queue, scheduler service, or AI service. Scrapes and rerates run inside the application process,
and a process-local singleflight lock prevents overlapping operations.

For user-facing behavior and local startup, start with the [project README](../README.md).

## Runtime modes

### Production

Production requires an explicit `DATABASE_URL`, a session secret, and a credential-encryption
master key. Cookie-session authentication and CSRF protection cover the writable HTTP surface.
The prepared deployment makes Caddy the only public listener and proxies requests to the private
application container backed by private Amazon RDS. The first production rollout is still pending.

The daily scheduler is enabled by configuration and runs inside the application process. The
current scheduler resolves exactly one owner before a scheduled scrape. It records a skipped run
instead of guessing when the owner is missing or ambiguous.

See the [production deployment reference](../deploy/production/README.md), the
[human rollout guide](../deploy/production/HUMAN_DEPLOY_GUIDE.md), and the
[RDS decision](superpowers/decisions/260710-rds-production-settings.md).

### Managed local app

When a non-production launch has no `DATABASE_URL`, `cmd/jobcron` starts or reuses the repository's
PostgreSQL 18 Compose service. It creates or reuses one fixed local owner and stores the database
cluster in a named Docker volume. The local HTTP surface uses that owner directly instead of
requiring login.

The app creates one protected local credential-encryption key on first use. PostgreSQL stores the
encrypted provider credential; the local key file stores only the master key used to decrypt it.

See the [local PostgreSQL guide](../deploy/local/README.md).

### Explicit local database

Setting `DATABASE_URL` outside production bypasses managed Compose startup. The target database
must already contain exactly one user. This mode is useful for development against an existing
PostgreSQL instance and for controlled migration verification.

### Read-only demo

Demo mode reuses the application and embedded frontend but rejects database mutations. Visitor
bookmark and hidden state stays in browser storage. An administrator token may authorize a demo
scrape, but ordinary visitors cannot scrape or rerate.

See the [demo deployment reference](../deploy/demo/README.md).

## Process and package boundaries

- `cmd/jobcron` loads configuration, resolves the database and owner, opens storage, wires
  scrapers, installs the credential cipher, heals interrupted scoring, starts the scheduler, and
  serves HTTP.
- `internal/server` owns routes, authentication middleware, scrape and rerate orchestration,
  rendering, Server-Sent Events, budgets, and the in-process scheduler.
- `internal/scraper` defines the normalized posting contract and shared robots, pacing, and
  experience helpers. Source subpackages implement individual job-board adapters.
- `internal/scoring` applies deterministic profile rules and merges cached AI facts and deltas.
- `internal/ai` defines the provider contract, Anthropic client, prompts, response parsing,
  evidence gates, and AI version identity.
- `internal/storage` exposes one concrete PostgreSQL-backed repository and applies embedded schema
  migrations. SQLite entry points exist only for the legacy importer and compatibility tests.
- `internal/credential` encrypts per-user provider credentials and manages the protected local
  master key.
- `internal/auth` creates password hashes and opaque session tokens.
- `web` embeds templates, styles, scripts, fonts, and icons into the Go binary.

These are concrete package boundaries rather than service boundaries. They run in one process and
communicate through ordinary Go calls.

## HTTP and identity flow

Production requests follow this path:

```text
request -> authentication -> CSRF check for mutations -> handler -> storage -> template or JSON/SSE
```

Login creates a random bearer token for the browser and stores only its SHA-256 hash in the
database. Production cookies are `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite=Lax`. Login failures are
rate-limited by client address and normalized email. Forwarded client addresses are trusted only
when the request carries the configured proxy secret.

Every authenticated handler resolves a `userID` before accessing profiles, saved-job state,
scores, AI usage, or credentials. Local mode supplies the fixed local owner's ID through the same
server methods. This keeps storage calls user-scoped even though the current product exposes only
one owner account.

Public signup, password recovery, organizations, and per-user schedules are not implemented. The
[multi-user expansion follow-up](superpowers/specs/260715-multi-user-account-expansion.md) records
that deferred product work.

## Scrape pipeline

A manual scrape uses a Server-Sent Events connection so the browser can display progress. The
actual work detaches from the request cancellation signal and runs with a bounded background
context. Closing the page therefore does not leave newly inserted postings unscored.

One scrape executes these steps:

1. Resolve the explicit user, profile, and optional AI runtime once.
2. Select profile-enabled scraper adapters.
3. For each source, check access policy, fetch listings, fetch required details, normalize fields,
   and upsert postings.
4. Isolate a failing source and continue with the remaining sources.
5. Sweep stale rows only for sources that completed successfully.
6. Mark cross-portal duplicates and retain one canonical posting.
7. Run or reuse global Stage 1A eligibility extraction for detailed postings.
8. Generate the active user's exact deterministic dealbreaker candidates.
9. Run or reuse user-scoped Stage 1B contextual validation within the shared paid-call budget.
10. Calculate deterministic scores from Stage 1A facts and conservatively merged Stage 1B
    verdicts.
11. Optionally run Stage 2 for the corrected eligible set and merge its cached deltas.
12. Finish the `scrape_runs` record with counts and any bounded error summary.

Scraper clients use shared request pacing and robots-policy helpers. The project prefers stable
HTTP or JSON endpoints and does not use browser automation for production scraping. See the
[source catalog](scraping/source-catalog.md) and the
[no-browser-driven-scraping decision](superpowers/decisions/260606-no-browser-driven-scraping.md).

## Scoring and AI

### Deterministic baseline

`internal/scoring` compares a normalized posting with the user's structured profile. Stack,
career, location, salary, and preference rules contribute explained line items. Hard keyword and
education dealbreakers exclude before any Stage 2 AI adjustment is merged. A career mismatch is a
separate reason; it becomes an exclusion only when the final score remains below `MinScore` after
Stage 2. Contextual validation may suppress an exact keyword hit only when its cited verdict is
`not_applicable`; it does not replace the deterministic candidate matcher.

This path requires no provider and remains the fallback for missing credentials, provider errors,
invalid model output, or exhausted AI budgets.

### Stage 1A: global posting facts

Stage 1A extracts career range, new-grad eligibility, education, and separate career and education
evidence from posting text. These facts describe the posting rather than a user, so the cache is
global and keyed by posting content and `EligibilityVersion`. Invalid or unavailable extraction
falls back to source fields and deterministic parsing.

### Stage 1B: user-scoped dealbreaker context

The deterministic matcher NFC-normalizes and lowercases text, then finds exact contiguous token
sequences from the user's dealbreaker list. Each match becomes a candidate whose stable identity
is the SHA-256 digest of that normalized token sequence.

Stage 1B batches only unresolved candidates and classifies each as `applies`, `not_applicable`, or
`uncertain`. Conclusive evidence must be a bounded verbatim quote from the posting and contain the
same candidate token sequence. The PostgreSQL cache key combines `user_id`, posting, posting
content hash, `DealbreakerVersion`, and normalized keyword hash, so neither users nor changed
inputs can share a verdict accidentally.

A keyword exclusion is suppressed only when every matched candidate is `not_applicable`.
`applies`, `uncertain`, missing cache entries, invalid evidence, unavailable credentials, provider
failures, and exhausted budgets all retain the deterministic exclusion. This conservative fallback
lets AI remove a supported false positive without silently weakening an unresolved hard rule.

Manual and opted-in scheduled scrapes may run Stage 1B before scoring. An explicit `AI 평가`
rerate also evaluates currently excluded candidates before rebuilding the eligible Stage 2 set.
Profile save and startup rescoring are provider-free: they reuse caches and mark missing validation
as pending instead of making surprise paid calls. Stage 1B and Stage 2 share the user's run budget
and call cap.

Scoring persists the exact decision in `ScoreResult.ExclusionReasons` inside
`scores.breakdown_json`. Rendering therefore explains the score that actually caused exclusion
without querying the validation cache or recalculating policy. The complete contract is in the
[Stage 1 contextual validation specification][stage1-context-spec].

### Stage 2: user fit

The second AI layer compares posting text with the user's free-text goals and dislikes. A
citation gate rejects unsupported adjustments. Accepted deltas, usage, and cache entries are
scoped by `user_id`, posting input, profile input, and AI version.

A rerate resolves one user's runtime and operates only on that user's visible rows. The scrape
pipeline may also run Stage 2 automatically for new postings. Per-call, per-run, daily, and monthly
limits bound paid usage; the usage ledger persists across restarts.

### Credential lifecycle

The profile form sends a newly entered provider key to the server. The server encrypts it with
AES-256-GCM before storing it in `user_ai_credentials`. Authenticated encryption binds the
ciphertext to its user, provider, and envelope version, so moving a row to another identity causes
decryption to fail.

The process decrypts a credential only while resolving that user's immutable AI runtime. The raw
key is not returned to the browser or written to logs. Production receives the master key from
configuration; managed local mode keeps it in a protected application-config file.

The completed storage and runtime design, migration contract, and remaining production rollout
gate are documented in the
[PostgreSQL convergence and per-user credential specification][postgres-credential-spec].

## Persistence and ownership

Normal application startup uses PostgreSQL only. `storage.OpenPostgres` checks connectivity and
applies pending embedded migrations transactionally before returning the repository.

The main ownership split is:

- Shared posting facts: postings, canonical-duplicate relationships, global Stage 1A extractions,
  and scrape-run history.
- User-owned state: profiles, deterministic scores, bookmarks, hidden or not-interested state,
  Stage 1B validations, Stage 2 scores, AI usage, and encrypted AI credentials.
- Authentication state: users and hashed login sessions.

Foreign keys remove dependent user state when its owner is deleted. Composite keys and repository
methods include `user_id` wherever two accounts must not share state. The current owner-only UI is
therefore a product limitation, not a storage shortcut.

Legacy SQLite is not a writable runtime. `cmd/jobcron-import` creates a verified snapshot, checks
counts and collisions, and imports preserved local data into an existing PostgreSQL owner.
`cmd/jobcron-user` creates or repairs that owner outside the public application surface. SQLite
migrations remain embedded only for importer compatibility and tests.

See the [hosted-first storage decision][hosted-first-storage] and the
[local import procedure](../deploy/local/README.md#verified-sqlite-import).

## Rendering and browser behavior

The Go binary embeds all templates and static assets through `embed.FS`. Handlers load a
user-scoped view model, then render it with `html/template`, which escapes untrusted posting text
by default. Small JavaScript modules handle streaming progress, rerate state, bookmarks, source
filters, theme selection, and briefing-notification state.

The browser is not a second database for the writable app. Durable profiles, scores, and saved-job
state live in PostgreSQL so they follow the account across devices. Browser storage is reserved for
presentation preferences and the temporary read-only demo behavior.

Excluded daily and archive rows reuse one template partial that shows every persisted reason in
profile order. The panel includes a visible label, conservative confidence text, and cited evidence
when available. Keyword evidence is split into ordinary strings plus a marked token span; Go
templates escape every segment, and provider output never becomes `template.HTML`. The danger
styling keeps the full row at normal contrast and uses text and a warning symbol in addition to
color.

## Deployment boundaries

The prepared production deployment uses an immutable Linux arm64 container image. Caddy
terminates TLS and is the only public component. The application port and RDS database remain
private. Application state and encrypted AI credentials live in PostgreSQL; production mounts no
application-data or legacy-key volume.

Local development runs the same application and PostgreSQL storage contract. Compose manages only
the local database lifecycle; the application remains a normal host process unless the operator
explicitly chooses another setup.

Stable deployment choices are recorded in the
[production and naming decision](superpowers/decisions/260711-jobcron-production.md). Exact operator
steps belong in the [production guide](../deploy/production/README.md), not in this architecture
overview.

## Failure boundaries

- One source failure does not discard successful results from other sources.
- Stale-row sweeping runs only for sources that supplied a trustworthy fresh baseline.
- AI failure degrades to deterministic scoring rather than failing the scrape or page.
- Stage 1B failure retains the deterministic exclusion with an unverified status; it cannot abort
  scrape, profile save, startup, or provider-free rescoring.
- Missing or ambiguous scheduler ownership records a skipped run instead of selecting a user.
- Startup rescoring repairs postings left without scores after an interrupted prior run.
- Database migration failure prevents startup before the server accepts requests.

## Planned architecture changes

The following work is documented but is not part of the implemented architecture:

- [Multi-user account and scheduler expansion][multi-user-spec]

When this change is implemented, update this document to describe the resulting current state
and move completed implementation records through the documented lifecycle.
